About 
I love everything technology, from video games to programming languages to hardware. I spend most of my free time learning new things and reading about innovative technology. I’m an avid traveler and hiker. My recent travels brought me to Craters of the Moon National Park in Idaho and running a half marathon in Breckenridge, Colorado. 
For work, I am a technical support specialist for Toast, Inc. It’s a challenging, yet fun work environment that I enjoy going to everyday! I’m also currently a student at the University of Nebraska – Omaha studying for a Bachelor’s of Multidisciplinary Studies. Within this major, I have three concentrations consisting of General Administration, Computer Science and Management Information Systems. I intend to pursue my Master’s in Computer Science afterwards.


Portfolio

Dayze – This is the first application that I ever made. It’s made in Python and is incredibly simple. This was the first time I went off on my own away from any tutorials or online courses. It was interesting to learn more about the datetime library within the language and I learned a lot!

Bowling Pins – I created this 3D model in Blender. I’ve always enjoyed art and after high school I haven’t had the chance to work on anything artistic. I decided to pick up Blender in September 2018 and this was the 3D scene I created.
